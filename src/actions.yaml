cluster-status:
  description: |
    Show status of an OVN cluster. Action result will contain two keys,
    "ovnsb" and "ovnnb", each of these keys will contain yaml structure with data
    from "ovn-appctl cluster/status" command representing status of Southbound and
    Northbound clusters. Additional "unit_map" key is included in each cluster status
    that pairs server IDs of cluster members with unit IDs on which these servers run.
    In case the action finds servers in cluster that are not associated with any known
    unit, the "unit_map" will also include key "UNKNOWN" with list of these
    disassociated servers.

cluster-kick:
  description: |
    Request removal of a server from the cluster. This action is equivalent to running
    "ovn-appctl cluster/kick" command and can be run on any unit connected to the
    cluster. This action takes ID of a server in southbound or northbound cluster
    (or both) as an argument. At least one of these arguments must be specified. To get
    the list of servers (and their IDs) connected to the cluster, user can run
    "cluster-status" action.
