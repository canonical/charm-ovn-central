options:
  source:
    default: zed
    type: string
    description: |
      Repository from which to install packages.

      May be one of the following:

        distro (default)
        ppa:somecustom/ppa (PPA name must include UCA OpenStack Release name)
        deb url sources entry|key id
        or a supported Ubuntu Cloud Archive pocket.

      Supported Ubuntu Cloud Archive pockets include:

        cloud:xenial-pike
        cloud:xenial-queens
        cloud:bionic-rocky

      Note that updating this setting to a source that is known to
      provide a later version of Ceph will trigger a software
      upgrade.
  ovn-source:
    default: ''
    type: string
    description: |
      Overlay repository from which to install OVS+OVN.

      The default for this configuration option is determined at charm
      runtime.

      When charm is deployed into a fresh environment on Ubuntu
      20.04 (Focal Fossa), the default will be 'focal-ovn-22.03'.

      When charm is upgraded or deployed into a fresh environment
      on a different series the default will be to not use the
      overlay repository.

      To disable the overlay repository, set this option to 'distro'.

      Note that updating this setting to a source that is known to
      provide a later version of OVN will trigger a software
      upgrade.
  ovsdb-server-election-timer:
    default: 4
    type: int
    description: |
      Raft leader election timeout in seconds. The charm allows a value between
      1 and 60 seconds.
      .
      The Open vSwitch ovsdb-server default of 1 second may not be sufficient
      for a loaded cluster where the database server may be too busy serving
      requests to respond to elections in time.
      .
      Using a higher value will increase the time to discover a real failure,
      but you must weigh that against the risk of spurious leader flapping and
      the unwanted churn that entails.
      .
      NOTE: The ovsdb-server will refuse to decrease or increase the value of
      this timer more than 2x the current value. The charm will compensate for
      this and decrease / increase the timer in increments, but care should be
      taken to not decrease / increase the value too much in one operation.
  ovsdb-server-inactivity-probe:
    default: 60
    type: int
    description: |
      Maximum number of seconds of idle time on connection to client before
      sending an inactivity probe message.

      The Open vSwitch ovsdb-server default of 5 seconds may not be sufficient
      depending on type and load of the CMS you want to connect to OVN.
  nagios_context:
    default: "juju"
    type: string
    description: |
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    default: ""
    type: string
    description: |
      Comma separated list of nagios servicegroups for the service checks.
  enable-auto-restarts:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: |
      Allow the charm and packages to restart services automatically when
      required.
